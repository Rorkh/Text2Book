## Introduction

Text2Book is a web application that allows users to convert text into Minecraft books by generating commands for command
blocks or text sections which can be manually copied over. This tool is designed to simplify the process of creating
in-game books with custom content for Minecraft players and mapmakers. Instead of manually entering lengthy commands or
taking a wild guess how much text to copy over on each page, Text2Book automates the process, making it quicker and more
user-friendly.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Enter the desired text content directly into the application.
- **Command Generation**: Generate the necessary commands to create the Minecraft books with the desired content.
- **Text Generation**: Generate text sections which can be copied over to your Minecraft book.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easily copy the generated commands to your clipboard for quick in-game implementation.

## How to Use

There are two generation modes you can choose from: **Commands** or **Text**.

### Text Generation:

1. **Input Text**: Enter the content you wish to appear in your Minecraft book in the designated text box.

2. **Generate Text**: Click the "Generate Text" button after entering your desired content. The application will process
   your input and generate the necessary sections of text for your Minecraft book.

3. **Copy Text**: Once the text sections are generated, they will be displayed on the screen. Click the "Copy" button
   next to each section to copy them to your clipboard.

4. **Implement in Minecraft**: Open Minecraft and access the book interface. Paste the copied text sections into each
   page of the book manually.

### Command Generation

1. **Input Text**: On the main page, you will find a text input box where you can enter the content you want to appear
   in your Minecraft book.

2. **Generate Commands**: After entering desired content, click the "Generate" button. The application will process your
   input and generate the necessary commands to create the Minecraft book with the given content.

4. **Copy Commands**: Once the commands are generated, you will see them on the screen. Click the "Copy" button next to
   the commands to copy them to your clipboard.

5. **Implement in Minecraft**: Open your Minecraft world and access a command block. Paste the copied commands into the
   command block to create the Minecraft book. Activate the command block, and the book will be available in-game for
   players to read.
